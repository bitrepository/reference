/**
 * <p>
 * This package implementes a reference pillar.
 * </p><p>
 * The class @see org.bitrepository.pillar.PillarAPI provides the basic interface for the reference pillar towards
 * the @see org.bitrepository.pillar.PillarMessageListener.
 * This gives the opportunity for different reference pillar implementations.
 * </p><p>
 * The @see org.bitrepository.pillar.PillarMessageListener provides the basic interface for receiving the different
 * message handled by the reference pillar.
 * </p><p>
 * The @see org.bitrepository.pillar.store.filearchive.ReferenceArchive handles the deposit of the files.
 * When retrieving a file, it is downloaded to the 'tmp' directory, and when the files is completed, then it is moved 
 * to the file directory.
 * If it at some later point is requested to be removed, then it is moved to an 'retain' directory.
 * </p><p>
 * The actual implementation of the reference pillar is in the 
 *  org.bitrepository.pillar.referencepillar.ReferencePillar class.
 * </p><p>
 * Automatical creation of the response message for the reference pillar is done in the
 *  org.bitrepository.pillar.ReferencePillarMessageFactory class.
 * </p><p>
 * The @see org.bitrepository.pillar.checksumpillar.ChecksumPillar is the implementation of the checksum pillar.
 * It does not store the files, only their checksums, and it will therefore not be able to handle some parts of the 
 * org.bitrepository.org.bitrepository.protocol.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Exceptions</h3>
 * All methods may throw IllegalArgumentException if parameters are null
 * or empty strings, and the documentation does not explicitly allow for this.
 * Also, parameter prerequisites described in documentation may result in an
 * IllegalArgumentException without this being declared.
