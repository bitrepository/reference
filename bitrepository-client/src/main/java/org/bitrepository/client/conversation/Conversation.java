/**
 * A conversation models the messaging based workflow used to accomplish a operation called on a client interface.
 * <p>
 * The interface primarily consists of sending and receiving message functionality.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation considerations</h3>
 * <p>
 * The following concerns needs to be addressed by classes implementing this interface.
 *
 * <h4>Threadsafe</h4>
 * Note that conversation needs to be thread safe as multiple messages and timer event may occur in parallel.
 *
 * <h4>Timeouts</h4>
 * The conversation implementation should include timeouts for the different conversation phases.
 *
 * <h4>Error handling</h4>
 * As a conversation will normally be called in either an asynchronous way, using a callback listener, or synchronous;
 * the error handling needs to behave differently in the two cases. This means an error handling block will typically
 * contain a
 * <p> <code>if (callbackListener == null) { ... } else {...}</code> </p>
 * block.
