    Settings for defining the different permission in the collection. 
    Permissions are needed when one or more of the following is true:
      - The messagebus is encrypted
      - A file transfer protocol requires certificates (i.e. when using https)
      - Messages needs signing (for MessageAuthentication or OperationAuthorization)
    
    A permission contains:
      - Description, a textual description to tell who, what and why. 
      - Certificate, the Certificate and optionally who is allowed to use it
      - InfrastructurePermission, a list of infrastructure related permissions
      - OperationPermission, a list of permissions related to operations 
        and where it pertains. The OperationPermission's list is optional.

    A certificate element consists of:
      - CertificateData, the base64 encoded public part of a X.509 certificate
      - AllowedCertificateUsers, contains a list of IDs for the components allowed
        to use the certificate. The list is optional. 
   
    InfrastructurePermission can be either: 
      - MessageBusServer, used for the messagebus server's certificate
      - MessageBusClient, used for clients of the messagebus
      - FileExchangeServer, used for file exchange server certificate
      - FileExcahngeClient, used for clients of the file exchange server
      - MessageSigner, used for pillars to allow them to sign messages (responses)
      
    OperationPermission element consistes of:
      - Operation, which is one of:
        + GetFile, for allowing IdentifyPillarsForGetFileRequest's and GetFileRequest's.
        + PutFile, for allowing IdentifyPillarsForPutFileRequest's and PutFileRequest's.
        + GetChecksums, for allowing IdentifyPillarsForGetChecksumsRequest's and 
          GetChecksumsRequest's.
        + GetFileIDs, for allowing IdentifyPillarsForGetFileIDsRequest's and 
          GetFileIDsRequest's.
        + DeleteFile, for allowing IdentifyPillarsForDeleteFileRequest's and
          DeleteFileRequest's.
        + ReplaceFile, for allowing IdentifyPillarsForReplaceFileRequest's and
          ReplaceFileRequest's. 
        + GetAuditTrails, for allowing IdentifyContributorsForGetAuditTrailsRequest's 
          and GetAuditTrailsRequest's
        + GetStatus, for allowing IdentifyContributorsForGetStatusRequest's and 
          GetStatusRequest's. 
        + All, "meta permission" allowing anything to be performed. 
      - AllowedComponents, a list of IDs for components where the OperationPermission
        is valid.
